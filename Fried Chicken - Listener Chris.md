### by Listener Chris

**Yield: 20 wings, drumsticks, or tenders. Recipe assumes about 2.5 lbs total chicken.**
**Prep time: 30 min**
**Wait time: 3 hours**
**Active time: 45 min**


## INGREDIENTS

* 2-2.5 lbs chicken wings, drumsticks, tenders, or mix
* 1 cup flour
* 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 2 tbsp corn starch
* 1 egg white
* 1 tbsp liquor
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 4 tbsp kosher salt

### SPICES (to taste)

* 4 tbsp Old Bay
* 2 tbsp Trader Joe's "21 Seasoning Salute"
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp cajun seasoning

## Phase 1: BRINE

1. Place the chicken in a large bowl or container with lid. No arrangement necessary.
2. Add spices to taste. Listener Chris likes:
  * 1-2 tbsp hot sauce
  * 2 heaping tbsp Old Bay
  * 1 heaping tbsp Trader Joe's "21 Spice Salute" 
  * 1 heaping tbsp chili powder
3. Add water to cover. Should be about 2 qts.
4. Add 3 tbsp of kosher salt. Use [Brine Calculator](https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/saltbrinecalculator.html) to calculate brines for other meat quantities or cuts.
5. Stir well and cover for 3-4 hours.

## Phase 2: DREDGE

1. In a medium bowl, mix spices to coat the chicken:
  * 1 cup AP flour
  * 1/2 cup bread crumbs or panko
  * 2 tbsp corn starch
  * 2 tbsp Old Bay
  * 1 tbsp Trader Joe's "21 Spice Salute"
  * 1 tbsp cajun seasoning (I use "Joe's Stuff")
  * 1 tbsp chili powder
  * 1 tbsp kosher salt
2. In a separate bowl, mix the pre-dredge dip:
  * 1 egg white
  * 1 tbsp liquor (at least 80 proof)
  * 1/2 cup buttermilk
3. Remove the chicken from the brine and rinse briefly.
4. Take two or three pieces of chicken at a time. Drop them into the buttermilk dip--be sure to let go completely. 
5. Remove the pieces from the buttermilk and drop them in the flour mix. Shake the bowl to help coat the pieces. Be sure to get the mixture all over the chicken!
6. Place the pieces on a baking sheet or other prep surface. Let sit for 10 minutes for coating to set.

## Phase 3: FRY

1. Add enough oil to a high-sided pan to about cover the pieces of chicken. This was about half a bottle of Wesson vegetable oil for me. Be sure to use an oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable or canola.
2. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F / ~180 C. Pre-heat your oven to the lowest setting. 
3. Place up to as many pieces of chicken in as can fit in the bottom of the pan. Leave some space between each piece.
4. Fry chicken until it reaches internal temp of 150 F / 66 C. The outside of the chicken should be a deep golden brown. Flip one or three times, depending on how bored you are.
5. Remove cooked chicken from the oil and set on baking sheet. Transfer batch to oven to keep warm while you fry the rest.

## Phase 4: EAT.

1. Eat.
